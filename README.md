# EPIS
An implementation of the Edge-Preserving Image Smooth (EPIS) algorithm discussed in this [paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~bisai/papers/SIGGRAPH15_IntrinsicDecomposition.pdf).

Our goal is to use this algorithm to enhance the compression of images while preserving essential structure
and details.
