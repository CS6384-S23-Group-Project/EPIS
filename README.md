# EPIS
An implementation of the Edge-Preserving Image Smooth (EPIS) algorithm discussed in this [paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~bisai/papers/SIGGRAPH15_IntrinsicDecomposition.pdf).

Our goal is to measure the impact of L1 piece-wise flattenning with edge-preserving on image compression for various image formats.
